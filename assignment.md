# Coding Test - Movie To Do List
The goal for this coding test is to create a web application where you can create a list of upcoming movies which you would like to see.

## Technology Stack
You need to use React to develop the web application, but you are free to choose the remaining libraries. You are also free to use pre-configured tools, such as 'create-react-app' or 'typescript-react-starter'.

## Web Application Requirements
1. The web application should have two pages: 'Upcoming movies' and 'Watch list'
2. In 'Upcoming movies', all upcoming movies should be listed.
3. In 'Upcoming movies', the user should be able to add a movie to their watch list.
4. In 'Watch list', all movies the user wants to see should be listed.
5. In 'Watch list', all movies should be sorted by release date (descending - most recent movie first). 
6. In 'Watch list', the user should be able to remove a movie from their watch list. 
7. A movie should show the following information:
  - Title
  - Average vote
  - Overview
  - Release date
  - Genres
  - Poster

### Movie API
For this task, please use the following movie database API: https://www.themoviedb.org/

To use the API, you need to create an account and request an API key. When you fill out the form to get the API key, you can just enter 'test' or any other text in the input fields.

To get the upcoming movies, you can use the following API: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-upcoming

## Optional
If possible, you can also write the necessary tests to validate the application.
